Convex Optimization Final Project

To Run the code in this project, add all of the folders to your Matlab envirnment and run 'script_pipeline.m'

Please note: Most of the scripts have an 'isPlot' and/or 'isDisplay' flag. Most of the time these will not slow down performance, however with the examples that have many datapoint (ie Largerado), we do not recommend turning isPlot on.
